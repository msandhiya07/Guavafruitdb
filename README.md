Guava (Psidium guajava) is a key crop in South Asia, especially in Bangladesh. Rich in vitamin C and fiber, it supports regional economies and nutrition. Unfortunately, guava production is threatened by diseases that reduce yields. This dataset is designed to aid the development of machine learning models for early disease detection in guava fruit, helping to protect harvests and reduce economic losses.

Dataset Summary
This dataset includes 473 annotated images of guava fruits, categorized into three classes. Images underwent preprocessing steps such as unsharp masking and CLAHE. The preprocessed images are augmented to increase in number to 3,784 image data. The three classes are:

Anthracnose
Fruit Flies
Healthy fruits
Images were collected from guava orchards in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh, during the fruit-ripening season in July when disease vulnerability is highest. A plant pathologist verified the images for accuracy in classification. Each image was preprocessed to a consistent size of 512 x 512 pixels in RGB format, suitable for deep learning and image processing applications.
Usage and Applications
This dataset is ideal for training and testing machine learning models aimed at:

Automatic Disease Detection: Enabling quick and accurate detection of common guava diseases.
Image Classification: Useful for supervised learning in agricultural applications.
Research in Computer Vision: Supports studies focused on plant pathology using image processing.
